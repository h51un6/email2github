## Requisites

Important : email2github requires python >=3.8.

Your personal repository on github will need two elements : 

- An authentication token : 

This tool uses the Github API. Please create a personal access token by following [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). The scope of the token must include "repo" and "delete_repo", as the tool will create and delete fake private repositories.

Important : the token is asked at the first start and then saved as a json file inside a tmp directory in the repo. If you need to remove the token from the cache, simply edit or delete this file.

- a ssh public key : 

Generate a ssh key on your machine : 

```ssh-keygen -f github -C github```

Here the key will be named github and the domain will also be github. But feel free to change these values.

Export the public key to your github account.
